## Power BI Visualizations
The analysis is presented using the following **Power BI** visualizations:
1. **App Ratings Distribution**: A bar chart showing the distribution of app ratings across different categories.
2. **Top Categories by Installs**: A column chart displaying the most popular app categories based on the total number of installs.
3. **Price vs. Installs**: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the price of an app and the number of installs.
4. **Review Analysis**: A line graph showing the correlation between user reviews and app ratings over time.
5. **Word Cloud of App Categories**: A word cloud highlighting the most frequent app categories in the dataset.
6. **App Size vs. Rating**: A bubble chart comparing the size of an app to its average rating.
7. **Revenue Analysis for Paid Apps**: A pie chart to analyze the contribution of paid apps to the overall revenue.

## Key Insights
- **Most Popular Categories**: Categories such as "Games" and "Education" have the highest number of apps and downloads.
- **Price and Install Relationship**: Free apps generally have more installs compared to paid apps.
- **Rating Trends**: Apps with higher ratings tend to have more reviews, indicating user satisfaction.
- **Size and Rating**: There is no strong correlation between app size and user ratings, indicating other factors contribute to app popularity.
